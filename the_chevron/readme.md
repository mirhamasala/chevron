# The Chevron

I made this a few days ago, when you click the chevron `>` the block beneath it becomes visible and when you click it again it toggles back to hidden.

Itâ€™s pure CSS, no javascript at all. Can you tell me how I did it? Or make one yourself.

The simplest form is between 10 and 20 lines of CSS. If it gets much more than that ask me and explain your process.
